        Oh-ooh-whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
        Oh-ooh-whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
        Oh-ooh-whoa-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
        You know you love me (yo), I know you care (uh-huh)
        Just shout whenever (yo), and I'll be there (uh-huh)
        You are my love (yo), you are my heart (uh-huh)
        And we will never, ever, ever be apart (yo, uh-huh)
        Are we an item? (Yo) girl, quit playin' (uh-huh)
        "We're just friends" (yo), what are you sayin'? (Uh-huh)
        Said, "There's another" (yo), and looked right in my eyes (uh-huh)
        My first love broke my heart for the first time, and I was like (yo, uh-huh)
        "Baby, baby, baby, oh"
        Like, "Baby, baby, baby, no"
        Like, "Baby, baby, baby, oh"
        I thought you'd always be mine, mine
        "Baby, baby, baby, oh"
        Like, "Baby, baby, baby, no"
        Like, "Baby, baby, baby, oh"
        I thought you'd always be mine, mine
